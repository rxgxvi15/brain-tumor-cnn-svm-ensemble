# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection using CNN + SVM Ensemble

This project focuses on detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images using advanced machine learning techniques. A hybrid approach is implemented where:

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is used for deep feature extraction from MRI scans.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** is applied as a powerful classifier on top of the CNN-extracted features.

This ensemble technique combines the strengths of deep learning and traditional ML to achieve high accuracy in tumor classification tasks.
